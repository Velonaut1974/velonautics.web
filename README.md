⚓ VELONAUT: Institutional Forensic Ledger
Professional Manual & Asset Governance Guide

Welcome to VELONAUT. This is a forensic infrastructure tool designed to transform raw shipping telemetry into certified, tradable regulatory assets. By applying "Arithmetic Sovereignty," we ensure that every gram of fuel saved is converted into a high-value compliance token that can be banked, traded, or used to offset fleet liabilities.
1. Access & Identity Control (The Trust Layer)

Value requires trust. We ensure every economic action is tied to an authorized individual.

    Operator Identity: Select your professional identity from the registry.

    Access PIN: High-privilege actions, especially generating assets, require your 4-digit PIN (Default: 1234).

    Role-Based Authority: The system distinguishes between OWNERS (who sign assets) and AUDITORS (who verify them).

2. System Control Interface (The Economic Cockpit)

This is where maritime operations meet the carbon market.

    Compliance Period: Set the reporting year (e.g., 2026) to align with FuelEU Maritime cycles.

    Market Data: Monitor the live EUA ETS Price to see the "Est. Market Value" of your generated assets.

    Key Rotation: Rotate the signing key to ensure the "digital seal" used to mint your assets remains uncompromised.

3. Fleet Gateway & Validation Buffer

Before a report can become an asset, its integrity must be absolute.

    Telemetry Intake: Noon Reports are received and timestamped with a "Forensic Receipt Hash".

    Validation Buffer: Suspicious data (e.g., "High Consumption Flag") is quarantined.

    Approval: You must manually "Approve for Compliance Use" to move data into the "Eligibility Pool".

4. Asset Governance Center (The Mint)

This is where your operational efficiency is "tokenized."

    Live Metrics: The system calculates "Verified Fuel" and "CO2​ Emissions" against official FuelEU factors.

    Institutional Commit: Clicking this button "burns" the surplus into a certified block, turning math into a Sovereign Asset.

    PDF Certification: Every commit creates a signed PDF document, serving as official proof of value.

5. Comprehensive FAQ Section
💼 Business & Economics

    How does this make us money?
    By proving efficiency with forensic certainty, you create "Compliance Surplus" units which have a direct market value in Euros under EU ETS and FuelEU.

    Is the PDF a "Token"?
    The PDF is for humans, but the "Block Hash" in the Ledger is the actual digital token—it is unique and impossible to forge.

    Can we pool these assets?
    Yes, the verified "Compliance Balance" can be used for fleet pooling or banking for future years.

🛡️ Safety & Security

    What happens if the database is deleted?
    If the velonaut_main.sqlite is lost, the chain is broken. However, our "Self-Healing" logic recreates essential registry tables upon restart.

    How secure is the signing process?
    We use Ed25519 signatures, a modern cryptographic standard that ensures the "Seal" cannot be faked even by someone with database access.

    What is "Key Rotation"?
    It’s like changing the locks on a vault. It ensures that even if an old key is compromised, your future assets remain secure.

⚙️ App Operation (User Guide)

    Why can't I click "Commit"?
    You must be logged in as an OWNER and provide a "Certification Statement" for the audit trail.

    What if a report is wrong?
    Use the Reject button in the Validation Buffer. This prevents incorrect data from ever entering the calculation pool.

    Why do I see an Anomaly Flag?
    The system automatically flags reports that exceed normal consumption limits (e.g., > 15 mt) to prevent fraud or data entry errors.

🔍 Audit-Readiness

    How do I prove this to an Auditor?
    Give them the Full Institutional Audit Trail (JSON) and the PDF Certificates. They can verify every signature independently.

    What is the "Forensic Replay Lab"?
    It allows auditors to pick any historical block and re-calculate the math. If the "Mathematical Fingerprint" matches, the audit is passed.

    Are the rules transparent?
    Yes. Every block saves the exact "Rule Set" (e.g., Emission Factors) used at that moment, so the math remains verifiable forever.
